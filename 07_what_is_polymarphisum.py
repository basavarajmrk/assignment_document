#07:what is polymarphisum.
# In programming, polymorphism means the same function name (but different signatures) being used for different types. The key difference is the data types and number of arguments used in function.
x = len("string")
print(x)
y = len([1,8,6,5,4,2,3])
print(y)


# here we use same funtion name len into two diffrent data types
